	<h1> I’m stuck! What do I do?! </h1>

	<h2> Part 1: How to approach a Practice Question.</h2>

	Read the question and any other background information carefully.
	<ul>
	<li> If there is code you don’t understand in the background information or the questions:</li>
	  <li>Try running it in the Jupyter Notebook to see what it does.</li>
	  <li>Use the help function to see how a specific function works.</li>
	<li> Look online at the Python documentation - use the search bar at the top. </li>
	  <li> https://docs.python.org/3/ </li>
	<li> If you can’t figure out how to do something specific, try Googling it. StackOverflow is a useful forum for troubleshooting.</li>
	<li> If you’re getting an error, read and try to understand the error and look for bugs in your code (ex. a parentheses in the wrong place, a missing argument to a function, etc.).</li>
	<li> Ask your neighbor if they have any ideas.</li><br>
	</ul>

	When to ask a facilitator for help:
	<ul>
	<li> If you have questions about how to troubleshoot a Practice Question.</li>
	<li>If you have been stuck on a Practice Question for more than a few minutes.</li>
	<li> If you have a more general question about understanding topics being covered in the Practice.</li><br>
	</ul>

	<h2> Part 2: How to approach a Challenge Question.</h2>

	Read the question carefully.
	<ul>
	<li> Think about the approach you will use to solve the problem. Write down the steps you need to take in your digital notebook.</li>
	<li> What objects will you need to make? (ex. variables, lists, functions, etc.)</li>
	<li> Can you break the question down into pieces?</li>
	<li> What are the logical steps you need to take to solve the problem? </li>
	<li> Starting with the first step, write the Python code to answer the question.</li>
	<li> If you get stuck (or even from the beginning), find a neighbor working on the problem and try figuring it out together.</li><br>
	</ul>

	When to ask a facilitator for help:
	<ul>
	<li> If you have questions about what the Challenge Question is asking.</li>
	<li> If you don’t know where to start and you have tried everything listed above.</li>
	<li> If you want to check that your logic makes sense.</li>
	<li> If you are trying to debug your code and have tried Googling it and asking your neighbor.</li>
	<li> If you want to check your answer.</li>
	</ul>
